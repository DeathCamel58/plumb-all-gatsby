  Plumb-All's Gatsby WordPress Site
</h1>
Didn't like how Wordpress was fairly slow. Decided to make our WordPress installation a headless CMS for speed. Using
GatsbyJS lets us do this quickly and effectively.

Deployed versions of this site can be viewed at [Plumb-All](https://plumb-all.com)'s site, and test deployments can be
viewed by going to a commit's actions, and looking at the Cloudflare Pages preview URL. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone Repo**

    Clone the Repo from GitHub

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/DeathCamel58/plumb-all-gatsby.git
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd plumb-all-gatsby/
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

## Backend WordPress Requirements
This gatsby theme *requires* both the WPGraphQL plugin and the
[WPGraphQL for SEOPress](https://github.com/moonmeister/wp-graphql-seopress) plugin.

Furthermore, because I maintain WPGraphQL for SEOPress, this gatsby theme may at times rely on my development branch of
the plugin (which I update for this theme), which can be found here: [DeathCamel58/wp-graphql-seopress](https://github.com/DeathCamel58/wp-graphql-seopress/)
